# TensorFlow 2.0 Tutors

this is a series tutorials based on tf2.0, it covers both NLP(rnn, lstm, transform..), CV(cnn, resnet, mobilenet..), GNN(nerual graph, auto graph..) and so on. This tutorial consist of with useful and productive example rather than snippets.

the example in this tutorial can be listed as follows:

- CV:
    - image classification on flowers(from scratch using MobileNetV2);
    - object detection using YoloV3(in another repo);
    - different backend in cv(resnet, resnext, squeezenet, alexnet, vgg, etc.);
    - image feature extraction;
    - image colorization;
    - GAN as pixel 2 pixel;
    - Face swap;

- NLP:
    - text classification;
    - transformer in language model;
    - translation model with tranformer;
    - sensitive classification in text;

More tutors with detailed blog will publish at http://talk.strangeai.pro . As well as [ZhihuZhuanlan]().
